•	Which assignment took you the longest to complete?
Assignment 1
•	  Which assignment was the most difficult?
None were really that difficult it was all just small things that needed to be solved with each assignment.
•	  Which assignment was the easiest?
Assignment 1
•	  Of the concepts we covered, which (if any) are you the most confused about still?
I do not think I am confused about any of the topics.
•	  If we had an extra week to spend on any of the concepts covered in this course, which one would it be?
I would like spending more time getting more used to writing code and understanding what really happens in the machine rather than learning more about the concepts because I feel like the concepts are easier to understand.
•	  Were there any assignments you felt were unnecessarily tedious (not necessarily difficult, but that took too long to complete)
I think every assignment was ok.
•	  Which assignment was your favorite?
I liked all the programming assignments because those are the ones where I learned most.
•	  Which assignment do you think you learned the most from?
I learned most from all of the programming assingments
•	  Were the assignment requirements and due dates clear enough? If not, how so?
They were clear and if anything was not clear it was cleared up soon.
•	  On a scale of 1-5, rate the difficulty (1=Breating, 5=Exiting Vim) of this course compared to other CIS courses you've taken.

•	  Was the book used in this course effective/helpful? Would you recommend a different one?
I personally am bad at reading and I avoid reading for every class so I would not know.
•	  Were there any topics that we didn't cover that you would have liked to see included?
I think the topics we covered were good.
•	  How can this course be improved?
I think the best way to improve the course is to have more focus on understanding how the code works and why each thing is there and what each thing does. I had an easy time understanding concepts and ideas that were explained on the board or excel but when it came to actual coding I was having a hard time understanding the syntax and the basics about what each thing does and why it does it. This could be because of my bad reading habits as well but I think the concepts are simple and some of the time spent on concepts could be spent on some more coding in class or something that is more involving and interactive like the programs you guided us through and explained what everything does. I think it is very useful when a concept is done in visual studios and each aspect is explained. It helps me understand better than the book because the book cannot interact with me and explain things I do not understand. Apart from that I think this class was pretty good.
